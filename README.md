# MULTIPLE REPARTITIONING test

Going to launch multiple repartition commands against cluster to check time constraints and measure skewness of resultant partitions.


## Highlights:

* Populate data from test input file
* Repartition the RDD over cluster of executors
* Check skewness against multiple partition keys
* Focus is also on running some automated tests later
* Also measure run-times
